# M5 — Security & Godmode

Objective
Provide an explicit, auditable high‑privilege mode with microVM isolation and strong user consent.

Scope
- GODMODE via microVM isolation (preferred) or host wrappers with clear warnings.
- Explicit confirmation flows; irreversible prompts; session banner.
- Resource budgets; network policies; basic exfiltration monitors.

Acceptance
- GODMODE is visibly distinct and requires strong user consent.
- Actions are fully logged; exit paths are explicit and safe.

Test plan
- Consent flows; isolation smoke tests; denial/allowlist behavior; audit trail verification.
