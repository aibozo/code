# M4 — Orchestrator

Objective
Manage full phase lifecycle, subagents, budgets, and robust transitions.

Scope
- Phase manager: enter/exit phases, expose phase‑scoped tools.
- Budgets: wall‑time, tokens, concurrency per phase; pause/resume.
- Subagents: OAuth preferred; fallback to API key; retry/validate wrappers.
- Rich summaries: deltas vs prior runs; next targets.

Acceptance
- Phases can run end‑to‑end with agent‑controlled pacing.
- Failures are visible with actionable recovery steps.

Test plan
- End‑to‑end mock cycles; tool availability checks; budget enforcement.
