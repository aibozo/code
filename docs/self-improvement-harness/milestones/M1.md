# M1 â€” Harness & Reports

Scope
- `harness/run.sh` orchestrator with stages: unit, integration, property, security, style, swebench (stub).
- Deterministic runs: `--seed` flag; schema v1 output.
- CLI integration: `code harness run [--seed N]`.
- TUI integration: `/reports` with date/run pickers and daily summary.

Acceptance
- Running the harness writes `harness/results/YYYYMMDD/<ts>.json`.
- TUI shows the latest run on startup if present; `/reports` navigates runs.
- Logs in `harness/artifacts/<ts>.log`.
