# M1.2 — Caching, Trends, Context, Phases

Scope
- Stage cache with hashed keys (script hash + git state + seed).
- TUI trends view (`/reports trends 7|30`) with daily ok/error bars.
- Context labels via `--context NAME`; show in report headers.
- Perpetual loop `/loop start|stop|status|sprint` (phase stubs).
- Documentation for phases, prompts, tools, and subagents.

Acceptance
- Runs include `cached` flags per stage; daily summaries include Σ cached.
- TUI trends render and the report header shows context when provided.
- Loop controls exist and do not degrade UX.
