# M1.1 — In‑TUI Harness Run & Autorun

Scope
- `/harness run [--seed N]` inside TUI.
- CLI `--startup-command "/harness run …"` to autorun at boot.
- Reports navigation polish: key hints, Esc to close, Left/Right run switching.

Acceptance
- A harness run can be triggered from the TUI and opens the resulting report view.
- Autorun on startup works and does not block the UI.
