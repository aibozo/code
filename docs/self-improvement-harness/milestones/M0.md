# M0 — Profiles & Policy

Scope
- Load `configs/policy.yaml` (small in‑house parser).
- Policy logging to JSONL; TUI startup notice.
- Pre‑exec warning/log when a command isn’t allowlisted for the active level.

Out of scope
- Real enforcement; only warnings and logs.

Acceptance
- A policy notice is visible on TUI startup.
- Running a disallowed command shows a `[policy] Warning:` prefix in stdout and appends to `logs/policy.jsonl`.
- No changes to sandbox enforcement behavior.
